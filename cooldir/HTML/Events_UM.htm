<h2 class="api">Events in the Fusion 360 API</h2>
<p Class="Normal">Events are the ability for you to receive notifications when certain actions occur within Fusion 360.  Events are a key component when creating custom Fusion 360 commands.  It’s through events that your program is able to know that the user clicked the button associated with your command, and then much of the behavior while is running, (preview, input validation, selection, etc.), is based on events.  Finally your program is notified through an event to execute the command and create the final result.</p>

<p Class="Normal">To implement an event you need to add a “handler” function to your code and connect that handler to the event.  Fusion 360 will call your handler function whenever the action occurs in Fusion 360 that causes the event to fire.  Even though the concept of implementing an event is the same, the actual practice is quite different from one language to another.  Specifics for setting up events is provided in the topics covering each of the supported languages; <a href="PythonSpecific_UM.htm">Python</a> and <a href="CPPSpecific_UM.htm">C++</a>.</p>

<p Class="Normal">One thing to be aware of that can significantly simplify adding support for events is that the "Syntax" portion of the help for every event has the code needed for the event handler and the connecting the handler to the event.  You can copy and paste this code from the help and make small edits to a couple of variable names and you'll have the event implemented.</p>

<br><br>

<p Class="Normal">There are some basic concepts that apply to all events regardless of which programming language you're using.
<ol>
<li>The initial access to an event is through a property on the object that supports the event.  For example, the UserInterface object supports the commandCreated, commandStarting, and several other events.  These are accessed through properties of the same name on the UserInterface object.  Events are listed in an "Events" section within the help topic of the object, as shown below.</li>

<div align="center"><img src="../images/EventsHelp1.png" align="middle" alt="Workspace Events"></div>
<br><br>

<li>The object returned by the event property is an object that derives from the Event base class.  Any object that derives from Event supports the "add" method, which you call to connect the event to your handler.  They also support the "remove" method to disconnect a handle, they support the "name" property, which returns the name of the event, and they support the "sender" property which returns the object that is firing the event.  For example, the ApplicationCommandEvent object returned by the commandStarting event will return the UserInterface object as the sender of the event.</li>

<li>When implementing the handler, the handler type must match the type of event.  For example, in the case of the commandStarting event, the event type is ApplicationCommandEvent and the handler is ApplicationCommandEventHandler.  All handlers support a single method named "notify".  The notify method is called by Fusion 360 when the event occurs and by reacting to the notify method you can handle the event.</li>

<li>The notify method has a single argument that provides an object that is derived from EventArgs. This object provides information about the event being fired. All objects derived from EventArgs support the firingEvent property which returns the event object that is firing the event.  In this example of the commandStarting event, it will return the ApplicationCommandEvent object.  Most objects derived from EventArgs also support other properties that provide additional information that is specific to that type of event. In the case of the notify method for the commandStarting event an ApplicationCommandEventArgs object is returned and it supports the commandDefinition, commandId, and isCanceled properties that are spescific to application command events.  These provide information about which command is starting and allow you to cancel it. </li>  
</ol>
