          What's New
        </h1><h3 class="api">Measure</h3>
<p class="api">This update includes the ability to do the same kinds of measurements in the API that you're able to do in the user-interface with the Measure command.  The new MeasureManager object provides access to the new functionality. There's a new <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?guid=GUID-4b13c86c-7aa0-4555-b3e3-02f7d1b01d10">sample program</a> that demonstrates much of the functionality. </p>

<h3 class="api">Temporary B-Rep Construction</h3>

<p class="api">
A completely new type of functionality has been added to allow you to do some basic solid modeling outside of any Fusion 360 documents. Some of the things supported are the creation of primitive solid shapes, Boolean operations, silhouette curves, intersection curves, various ways of creating wireframe geometry, imprinting of bodies, and reading and writing files containing the geometry descriptions. This is a direct interface to the internal modeling engine that Fusion 360 uses. Creating shapes this way is much faster because there’s no additional overhead of features, timeline, or even graphics. See the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?guid=GUID-2CA08FA9-8C23-4449-87C4-1CCBA87941C1">TemporaryBRepManager</a> object in the API help.
</p>

<h3 class="api">Other</h3>

<p class="api">The API now supports the twist and taper angle options of the sweep feature.</p>

<p class="api">There are now events fired when the user manipulates the view and changes the camera.  See the Application.cameraChanged event.</p>

<h3 class="api">Fixes</h3>

If the design is in a pending situation and you run a command like "Create Sketch", a dialog appears asking if you want to capture the current position or not before continuing. This is because the creation of a sketch can be dependent on the current positions of occurrences in the design. Other comamnds, like "Fillet", depend directly on model geometry and do not rely on occurrence positions so running the Fillet command does not display the dialog and does not affect the pending state of the occurrences.
 This property allows you to specify if your command is dependent on the current position of occurrences or not. One good way to know if your command is dependent or not is to run the commands in the UI that are  equivalent to the API functions you're using and see if the dialog that prompts to save or abort appears.  If it does, then you know your command is dependent on occurrence positions.
 If this property is true, then the dialog will appear if there are any pending moved occurrences. The user can choose whether to capture the current changes or abort them, and then your command will continue.
 If you set this property to false, (which is the default), then even if there are pending changes, the occurrences  are left in their current positions and your command will run.</td>

 This value is not necessarily related to what the user sees because the opacity is inherited. For example, if you this body is in a component and that component's opacity is set to something other than 1.0, the body will also be shown as slightly transparent even though the opacity  property for the body will return 1.0. Because the component that contains the body can be  referenced as an occurrence in other components and they can have different opacity settings,  it's possible that different instances of the same body can display using different opacity levels.  To get the opacity that it is being displayed with use the MeshBody.visibleOpacity property.
 This is the API equivalent of the "Opacity Control" command available for the body in the browser.</td>
