<p class="normal">AUTODESK IS WILLING TO LICENSE THE ACCOMPANYING SOFTWARE TO YOU ONLY UPON THE CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT AND ANY SUPPLEMENTARY OR UNIQUE LICENSE TERMS INCLUDED HEREWITH ("AGREEMENT").</p>

<h3 class="black"><b>YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE INDICATES YOUR ASSENT TO BE BOUND BY THE LICENSE TERMS SET FORTH BELOW.</b></h3>

<p>This Autodesk, Inc. ("Autodesk") License Agreement accompanies an Autodesk software product and related explanatory materials ("Software"). The term "Software" shall also include any upgrades, modified versions or updates of the Software licensed to you by Autodesk.</p>

<p class="normal">Autodesk grants to you a nonexclusive limited license to use and copy the Software, provided that you agree to the following:</p>

<h3 class="api">1. USE OF THE SOFTWARE.</h3>
<p class="normal">You may install the Software in a single location on a single hard disk or other storage device; post and make available the Software on a network file server for the purpose of installation onto hard disks or other storage devices or use of the Software over such network; and make backup copies of the Software. You may make unlimited copies of the Software and give copies to other persons or entities, including downloading the Software from the Internet or similar on-line source, so long as all such copies contain this Agreement and the same copyright and other proprietary notices that appear on or in the Software.</p>

<h3 class="api">2. COPYRIGHT/PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.</h3>
<p class="normal">The Software is owned by Autodesk and its suppliers, and its structure, organization and code are the valuable trade secrets of Autodesk and its suppliers. The Software is also protected by copyright law and international treaty provisions. You may use trademarks only to identify printed output produced by the Software, in accordance with accepted trademark practice, including identification of trademark owner's name. Such use of any trademark does not give you any rights of ownership in that trademark. Except as stated above, this Agreement does not grant you any intellectual property rights in the Software.</p>

<h3 class="api">3. RESTRICTIONS.</h3>
<p class="normal">You agree not to rent, lease, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Software except to the extent permitted by law where this is indispensable to obtain the information necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created program with the Software or with another program and such information is not readily available from Autodesk or elsewhere. You may not decompile the Software if such information is available by licensing any Autodesk Software Developer's Kit or other Autodesk software product through an Authorized Autodesk Reseller or a local Autodesk office.</p>

<p class="normal">You understand and acknowledge that this Agreement provides for the copying and distribution of the Software in its entirety and does not allow for partial distribution of any of the components (.dlls or other files) that make up the Software. Creating derivatives of the Software is strictly prohibited. Redistribution of: (i) the Software that is integrated with other technology as a component or standalone product and does not provide end user access to the complete install process; (ii) incomplete, modified, reverse engineered, or otherwise altered copies of the Software, is not permitted and will result in termination of this Agreement.</p>

COPYING THE SOFTWARE EXCEPT AS PERMITTED BY THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT IS COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT UNDER THE LAWS OF YOUR COUNTRY. IF YOU COPY THE SOFTWARE IN VIOLATION OF THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT THEN YOU ARE VIOLATING THE LAW. YOU MAY BE LIABLE TO AUTODESK FOR DAMAGES AND YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

<h3 class="api">4. NO WARRANTY.</h3>
<p class="normal">The Software is provided to you "AS IS," and you acknowledge that it may contain errors. Autodesk disclaims any warranty or liability obligations to you of any kind.</p>

<p class="normal">AUTODESK AND ITS SUPPLIERS DO NOT AND CANNOT WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS YOU MAY OBTAIN BY USING THE SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION. AUTODESK AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL AUTODESK OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, EVEN IF AN AUTODESK REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY.</p>

<p class="normal">Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or special damages, or the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty may last, so the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>
